Alana Wilson works primarily in ceramic, with a studio practice that also encompasses sculpture, photography, and printmaking. Forming a visual and conceptual lineage across mediums and processes, the Australian-born, New Zealand-raised artist questions the relationship between humans and their environments, and the scale of which we exist in nature. Often drawing upon natural, biographical, art historical and anthropological sources, Wilson’s work is inherently visceral, intimate and tactile. With a practice that involves a combination of philosophical enquiry and material investigation, the latter involves following instinct and experimentation in the studio. Firing to 1260ºC allows the metamorphosis of surface degradation to be captured, appearing to exist in a state of motion and decay, even once cooled.

"Recent contemplation of gesture, mark-making, and impression have been driving new work with experiments in printmaking, drawing, and ceramics."
Wilson’s oeuvre seeks to allude to the macrocosm of all and the interconnectedness of all life, from the intimate to the universal.

I acknowledge the Gayamaygal people of the Eora Nation as the first inhabitants and traditional custodians of the land on which I live and work. I pay respect to Elders past, present and emerging.
